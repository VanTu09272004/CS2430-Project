# Design Notes

- We use Java for this project.
- Ordinary sets use Boolean arrays.
- Multisets use an integer array (int[]) where each index represents the count of the corresponding element in the universal set.
- Union and intersection are implemented for sets.
- We separate logic into different classes.
- A main class runs test cases.
- Output is clearly labeled.
- No external libraries are used.
