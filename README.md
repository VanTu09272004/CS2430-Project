## Project Description
This project implements two data structures:

1. Ordinary sets using Boolean arrays.
2. Multisets using a HashMap to store element counts.

---

## Features
- Union operation
- Intersection operation
- Basic multiset operations (add, remove, count)
- Clearly labeled console output
- Multiple representative and edge test cases

---

## Test Cases
Test cases are implemented in `TestMain.java`.

The following cases are tested:
- Partial overlap
- Disjoint sets
- One empty set
- Both sets full

Outputs are clearly labeled in the console.

---

## How to Run
1. Compile all Java files inside the `src` folder.
2. Run `TestMain.java`.
3. Review the printed output in the console.
